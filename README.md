The role of the Technical Program Manager (TPM) is crucial in the tech industry, bridging the gap between technical expertise and business acumen. The second edition of the Technical Program Manager’s Handbook offers a comprehensive guide to excelling in this role. Building on the foundational concepts from the first edition, this updated version introduces new chapters that explore the integration of AI and Emotional Intelligence (EI) in program management. These crucial additions complement the broader focus of the book on bridging business and technology but don’t overshadow it. You'll learn how to apply AI-driven tools to enhance project planning, risk management, and stakeholder communication, as well as how to leverage EI to build strong team relationships and improve leadership effectiveness.
This book provides practical tools, methodologies, and case studies, offering insights from industry leaders to help both aspiring and practicing TPMs apply advanced concepts and strategies effectively. It also explores the unique aspects of the TPM role in major tech companies, helping you to navigate and thrive in your career.
By the end of this book, you'll have a clear understanding of the TPM role, along with a breakdown of the necessary technical and program management skills, to develop a clear roadmap for your career.</details>

  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
This book assumes you have a basic understanding of project management concepts. Any word that is specific to management or a technical background is explained, so no specific methodology is required, such as Project Management Professional terminology, or phase cycles.
From a technical perspective, an introductory programming course is enough to get value from the technical explanations in the code, system design, and architecture chapters.
